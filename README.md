# Blocks Edit editable tags
### Blocks Edit's library of tags to define editable features in your email template

**The Blocks Edit CMS framework is a simple library of tags based on classes, styles, and attributes that you add to your HTML code to define editable features.** However, with full flexibility comes great responsibility! While these set of properties are designed to work with any kind of custom-coded HTML template, it may take some finessing to get right. In the same way HTML and CSS are conceptually simple, it's in the practice of using them that yields powerful results.
